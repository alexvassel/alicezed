				<p>Site has a simple tree structure: it consists of the main page with a menu in which you can go to the pages of the second level. They have the same structure as the main page with changes in design and color scheme in accordance to the content.</p>
				<p>The menu is made by using the html-tag "canvas" and the programming language JavaScript. The background is made programmatically as smooth gradient from top to bottom.</p>

				<h2>Portfolio</h2>
				<p>Why not? :) It's my site-portfolio in which I try to put maximum creativity. I think a serious approach should be only to work, but in life you should be easy, funny and sociability. Especially if it comes to your portfolio, I think, you may have a bit fun in order to relax from the serious projects.</p>
				<p>The site has a simple structure. Main page is an only which is very different in structure because of non-standard location of the menu. There is no usual navigation block, all links are spread across the page in accordance with the background image. In other sections the menu is a horizontal bar with the links.</p>
				<p>This site made in the style of a low quality grunge. Sloppy, messy, sometimes ugly style, that is used by David Carson, was the main design for this project. The only thing that does not match is a font. Grunge fonts are fonts that are spread out around the edges, sloppy, inaccurate, like avant-garde posters of the end of 60s, i.e. until the advent of digital printing. In the case of this project - it is an individually selected font to the entire site that is embedded in it through the JavaScript and html-5 technologies. The bright splashes of colors add to the site a positivity and creativity and more than that they point on the field in which I work.</p>
				<p>The design was developed in Photoshop by experimenting with brushes, a combination of layers, applying filters to individual /old/images. In a network where everything is carefully laid out on shelves this style looks fresh. Home page of the site is the most developed. Background image modified many times before get this look. Was taken the own photo highly modified in the program Photoshop. Then there was added a texture and later found photos of colors and brushes. After there were added the numerous coffee and watercolor spots, two cups of coffee, coffee beans and spray paints. So was born the grunge on the site.</p>

				<h2>Evrograd</h2>
					<p>This is a site of the construction company "Evrograd". It was my first independent serious project and I tried to carry out all client's wishes. Of course, the design is not perfect, I know, but it's simple and clear, so it's good for usability. Also I think, that it's good if it answers the client's requirements. Because your wish is my command.</p>
					<p>Notice, that on this site I used php-code to send the form on the e-mail and also used the vk and facebook buttons that made for the first time. More than that I added a LiveInternet counter.</p>

				<h2>Do you know that..?</h2>
				<p>This is my first application for the iPhone or iPad, which allows users to know smth interesting about the world.</p>
				<h3>About what?</h3>
					<p>Don't know what to do with yourself? Do you tired of reading news and boring books? Don't talk about? Do your life seems gray, boring and depressing? And do you want something hot, interesting and exciting? If at least on one of these questions you answered "yes", then this application is created specifically for you. A huge number of interesting, strange, shocking and amazing facts from around the world are waiting for you. One click and all the wonderful news close to you immediately. More than that on the pages of this application you can find not only beautiful pictures for the each articles, but even a thematic music.</p>
				<h3>Why?</h3>
					<p>You ask me: "Why exactly this application? Why it is not about space, fashion, dogs or cats, politics, why not about movies or the main characters of your favorite book? Why it is not schedule of electric trains or maps of cities?" The idea of creation the application "Do you know that..?" was born suddenly and almost randomly. Just one day I went through the metro station "Revolution Square" and looked at how people stroke muzzles of dogs. Immediately I remembered that it is to good luck. And I was wondering what other interesting facts live around us.</p>
					<p>You ask me: "Why exactly application? Why I can not find an interesting information via the Internet?" I answer you: "Because you need to find. Because you want to read, but not straining or not looking".</p>
					<p>You ask me: "Why the application has exactly such design?" So, the design is made in the best traditions of the company Apple. Here an 'apple' theme was applied for it, but some colors and background image were changed to create an individual image. The font has remained as standard - Helvetica. All of the shadows, gradients, borders, buttons, arrows have not been changed too.</p>
					<p>You ask me: "Why blue?" Blue is the color of sky and sea, religions, art, music, peace, compassion and peace. It is the color of constancy and perseverance. The application is aimed at harmony with others, to the knowledge of the outside world, so the shades of blue are perfect here together, they are in harmony, do not cause irritability and tension. By the way this is the reason why many well-known companies are using this color as the main.</p>
					<p>You ask me: "Why exactly this logo?" Logo was created for a long time. It has been considered many options, including a hat magician, the human brain, monkey, people who share information, dialogue, different variations of question marks. All that associated with a mystery and a suspense. But the choice was made for a person with balloons in hand, which personify here the questions. A person finds answers to his questions and releases them from himself.
					<img src=""/> </p>
					
				<h3>For whom?</h3>
					<p>You ask me: "For whom is this application?" The most interesting fact is that this application will be interesting for everyone. You can not know everything, and now a one of the most important needs of modern person is to learn something new. Therefore the target audience is very different: the application will be perfect for both children and adults, both men and women. It does not matter either education or social status, or marital status or place of residence.</p>
				<h3>How?</h3>
					<p>You ask me: "How to use the application?" The application "Do you know that..?" Application is optimized for the iPhone 3g device, but it can also be easily viewed both on the iPhone 4 and the iPad, that allows considerably expand the potential audience.</p>
					<p>You ask me: "How it was done?" In the process of creating an application have been used such programs as Adobe Photoshop CS5 to edit all the /old/images that illustrate the content of each article and to create a seamless texture. Espresso program to create the application itself (html5, css3, JavaScript, jQuery), Adobe Illustrator CS5 program for creating and designing a logo and also such programs as Adobe Device Central CS5 and xCode to test applications on different devices. xCode is a program that was used not only for emulation iPad and iPhone devices, but also to connect the real device to the computer for further testing directly on it.</p>
					<p>You ask me: "How separate the articles?" The application consists of the links, which are separated into categories. People used to categorize everything, because a sort clearly separates one from another, making it easy to find the most relevant and interesting article. More than that every article contains a text and a picture. It helps visually interpret the information and allows to learn it better.</p>

				 <h2>Corporate identity</h2> 
				<p>It is not a site, but I think, that it should be placed near the web-site "Watchman" (next slide). It's my course project and it's a corporate identity of the company "Watchman", which I thought up. Since I decided what company I have chosen (they sell watches), I began to think about company's logo. Not long after I understood that such company had to have a logo, which would be easy readable and recognizable on the small clock dials. So born the company logo: 
				<img src=""/></p>
				
				<p>The basic corporate colors are dark red (# 993333), black and white. And also shades of gray. Because the logo consist the lines, the main theme of the corporate identity was chosen the lines too. So born the letterhead, the business card and the corporate envelope:   
				<img src=""/></p>
				<p>The dots that placed on the bottom are not obtrusive, but they fill the void and add an unique. After creating this style it was necessary to think about the development of the site design.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			
			<div><img src="/old/images/sit6.png" />
				<div class="description">
				<h2>Watchman</h2>
				<p>So, this is a site about the company "Watchman" which specializes in selling watches. The main condition of creating a design of this site was to link it with the corporate style of the company in order to a visitor could easily understand what kind of company it is. So has been created a header of the site. It is not very complicated, but recognizable because of the colors, lines and dots.</p>
				<p>A header is a very symmetrical, so the whole site was also centered. After the header is a gallery of /old/images from the watches that were found via the Internet, and then in the Photoshop program I added the company logo on them. It's all very relative, I know, but it is not an existing project, please make an allowance for this. A gallery (slideshow) was made by jQuery. </p>
				<p>The "collection" is made by the same jQuery code, but with different settings. It is possible not to connect any other plug-in, thereby saving time and place. Also here was configured pop-up window when the user hovers the cursor on the big picture of the goods. There displays the model number and price.</p>

				<h2>Advertising</h2>
					<p>After the development of corporate identity and creation the site, it was the task to create advertising. So I decided that the main advantage is durability of the goods, then the ads had been to reflect exactly this property primarily. </p>
				<h3>The purpose of developing</h3>
					<p>Declare about the company "Watchman", to focus consumers on the positive quality of the goods - durability.</p>
				<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
					<p>In the magazine: consumers often ignore these ads. In this sense television and radio advertising will be more effective. Moreover, readers of magazines, as a rule, mature individuals who are changing their preferences to certain goods with less desire than audiences of other media. Yet sometimes the quality of printed text is very low because of what lose the quality of photos, text, may disappear entirely a few details.</p>
					<p>In the billboards: people have only a few seconds to digest the information and it is constantly exposed to weathering and vandalism.</p>
				<h3>Idea</h3>
					<p>Match the word «durability» with a short-lived human life. To do this, was selected the image of the skeleton of a person with an intact watch on his arm. As another example: compare the word «durability» contrary to the strength and durability. Therefore it was chosen a picture of the sculpture with a clock on the hand. This approach helps the consumer to ensure a positive quality of the product on a comparative basis.
				<img src=""/>
				<img src=""/></p>
				
					<p>As another example, advertising in the magazine as a comic book where a person in an amusement park, playing, trying to break the clock with a hammer, but in the end he realizes that it is impossible, the clock remained intact. In my opinion, this is a good example of quality goods:
				<img src=""/></p>
				
				<h3>The purpose of the advertising campaign</h3>
					<p>To expand the range of consumers.</p>
				<h3>Slogan</h3>
					<p>The slogan is very simple and consists of one word - durability, which means strength, endurance, hard work. This slogan is short and understandable, and most importantly it immediately points consumers on the advantage of goods. Slogan supported by illustrations that clearly demonstrate this quality.</p>
				<h3>Conclusion</h3>	
					<p>The advertising campaign is to attract the attention of consumers, to increase their number, and finally to increase the number of sales. The main condition was to focus the buyer on the durability, quality and efficiency of goods, and also on the corporate identity (logo, colors).</p>
